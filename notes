run validation for staged files

https://vitest.dev/ for tests

would be great to have modular system to apply separate canvas managers and run them

main worker

all modules should have list of subscribers,
any emitted event from a module should be accepted by the subscriber
all subscribers should implement bypass logic to not run in infinite loop


fetch data in the background, store it, process it, print it

draw an countdown with decreasing circle line and countdown in the center
then update main image

creation of main worker should be independed from project
create of all necessary modules comes after creation of main worker
